## Project Description
Fresh fruits and vegetables are an important group of commodities in the US commonly transported by truck from fields in predominantly southern growing regions across the US (for instance, from California to the Northeast). While irrigation dampens the effect of rainfall crop yields, temperature and rainfall are still important factors in the timing of fresh fruit and vegetable harvest and thus transport. This work will examine the magnitude of impact of vegetable harvest timing on transportation costs, using external inputs like temperature and rainfall as well as variables intrinsic to the truckload market. Challenges include combining the geographic characteristics of the time series involved: univariate time series methods provide some benefit but stronger results come from exploiting geography and freight characteristics. Bayesian models and causal impact analysis are natural tools for this application.

## This Repository
The code in this repository is all of the code I personally contributed to the project. Much of the original data is confidential, but my `R` scripts implement various time-series algorithms and analyses related to the project.
